# topic recognition 

This is a Python application that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and recognize topics from a text corpus (within this context, it's the texts between my partner and I) . The app is designed to process textual data, such as your girlfriend's texts, and identify the main themes or topics discussed within the conversation.

Packages Used:
spacy
pandas
plotly


# How to use
This is not quite an analysis in which you can run, since it has data from my texts with my partner. Feel free to look through the notebook, however.
