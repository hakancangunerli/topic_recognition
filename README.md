# topic recognition 
This is a Python notebook that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and recognize topics from a text corpus (within this context, it's the texts between my partner and I). 

# Packages Used
spacy
pandas
plotly


# How to use
This is not quite an analysis in which you can run, since it has data from my texts with my partner. Feel free to look through the notebook, however.
